At its core, Supervised Machine Learning is about learning patterns from labeled data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Think of it as teaching a child with examples: you show them many pictures of cats and dogs, tell them which is which, and eventually they can recognize new animals they've never seen before.
